1. When I run the program I see a menu giving me options to use each of the functions of the program.

2. When I select the option it will output a randomly chosen student from the list.

3. When I select the option it will output a list of all of the students as randomly chosen pairs.

4. When I select the option it will output a random list of Peer Groups for all of the students (groups of 4 students).

5. When I run the program it should load the list of current students from a text file.
